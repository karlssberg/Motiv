# Motiv
## Turn your if-statements into _why_ statements

Motiv is a .NET library that supercharges the experience of working with boolean logic.
```csharp
    Spec.Build((Subscription subscription) => subscription.ExpiryDate < DateTime.Now)
        .WhenTrue("subscription has expired")
        .WhenFalse("subscription is still active")
        .Create();
```

It allows you to package your boolean expressions into strongly typed _propositions_.
By propositions, we mean a declarative statement that can later be evaluated to either true or false.

Examples of propositions include:
* _the sun is shining_
* _email address is missing an @ symbol_
* _the subscription is within a grace period_


Propositions can be composed together using boolean operators, such as `&`, `|`, and `^`, and when evaluated will only
surface the reasons (or custom metadata) from propositions that determined the final result.

```csharp
var isUsefulLibrary = isEasyToDebug & (hasExplanations | hasCustomMetadata) & isReusable & isComposable;

var result = isUsefulLibrary.IsSatisfiedBy(new InferiorAlternative());  // evaluate proposition

result.Satisfied; // false
result.Assertions; // ["is difficult to debug", "no explanations", "no custom metadata"]
```

#### What can I use the Motiv for?
Motiv is not specifically focused on catering to any particular use-case (except maybe _Developer Experience_),
but it does nonetheless serve use-cases such as:

* **User feedback** - You require an application to provide detailed and accurate feedback to the user about why a 
  certain decisions were made. 
* **Debugging** - Quickly understand why a certain condition was met (or not). When faced with deeply nested 
  if-else statements it can be challenging to comprehend the bigger picture. Motiv gives you the wherewithal to 
  separate the implementation details from the big-picture logical expression.
* **Multilingual support** - Use custom POCO objects instead of strings to provide multi-language support.
* **Decomposing complex logic or domain rules** - Whether you are faithfully modelling domain logic, or just trying to 
  decompose an unwieldy logical expression, Motiv can help you to break it down into more manageable and 
  understandable parts.
* **Validation** - Ensure user input meets certain criteria and provide detailed feedback when it does not.  Because 
  of the approach Motiv takes, it makes it relatively straightforward to convert existing logic into validation logic.
* **Parsing CLI arguments** - The command line arguments array can be interrogated and mapped to state 
  objects (metadata) to help conditionally drive behavior in the application.

You are encouraged to explore the library and find new and innovative ways to use it.

## Usage
All propositions follow the same basic usage pattern that starts with a call `Spec.Build()`.
It has many overloads for different use-cases, but they all trace back eventually to a boolean predicate functionâ€”in 
other words a `Spec.Build(Func<TModel, bool> predicate)`.

### Basic proposition
A basic proposition can be created calling the `Spec.Build()` method and then calling the `Create()` method without 
calling any other builder methods in between.

For exampe:
```csharp
var isEligibleForLoan =
    Spec.Build((Customer customer) => 
            customer is                 // predicate
            {
                CreditScore: > 600,
                Income: > 100000
            })                         
        .Create("eligible for loan");   // propositional statement
```

This can then be evaluated by calling the `IsSatisfiedBy()` method and passing in a model to evaluate.
```csharp
var result = isEligibleForLoan.IsSatisfiedBy(eligibleCustomer);  // evaluate proposition as satisfied

result.Satisfied; // true
result.Reason; // "eligible for loan"
result.Assertions; // ["eligible for loan"]
```

When negated, a basic proposition will return a reason prefixed with a `!` character.
This is useful for debugging purposes.

```csharp
var result = isEligibleForLoan.IsSatisfiedBy(uneligibleCustomer); // evaluate proposition as unsatisifed

result.Satisfied; // false
result.Reason; // "!eligible for loan"
result.Assertions; // ["!eligible for loan"]
```

Basic propositions are useful for encapsulation and debugging purposes, but their explanations are not particularly
user-friendly.

### Propositions with explanations
You can use the `WhenTrue()` and `WhenFalse()` methods to provide user-friendly explanations about the result.
These values will be used in the `Reason` and `Assertions` properties of the result.

```csharp
var isEligibleForLoan =
    Spec.Build((Customer customer) => customer is
            {
                CreditScore: > 600,
                Income: > 100000
            })
        .WhenTrue("customer is eligible for a loan")        // yield explanation when true
        .WhenFalse("customer is not eligible for a loan")   // yield explanation when false
        .Create();

var result = isEligibleForLoan.IsSatisfiedBy(eligibleCustomer);

result.Satisfied; // true
result.Reason; // "customer is eligible for a loan"
result.Assertions; // ["customer is eligible for a loan"]
```

### Propositions with custom metadata
You are also not limited to strings.
You can equally supply any POCO object, and it will be yielded when appropriate.

```csharp
var isEligibleForLoan =
    Spec.Build((Customer customer) => customer is
            {
                CreditScore: > 600,
                Income: > 100000
            })
        .WhenTrue(new MyMetadata("customer is eligible for a loan"))        // yield POCO object when true
        .WhenFalse(new MyMetadata("customer is not eligible for a loan"))   // yield POCO object when false
        .Create("eligible for loan");

var result = isNegative.IsSatisfiedBy(eligibleCustomer);

result.Satisfied; // true
result.Reason; // "eligible for loan"
result.Assertions; // ["eligible for loan"]
result.Metadata; // [{ Message = "customer is eligible for a loan" }]
````

### Dynamic explanations (and metadata)
There will be times when you need to provide a more dynamic explanation (or metadata object).
There are overloads to the `WhenTrue()` and `WhenFalse()` methods that allow you to provide a function that will be
evaluated when the proposition is satisfied.
These functions can be used to dynamically generate explanations or metadata based on the model being evaluated.
```csharp
var isEligibleForLoan =
    Spec.Build((Customer customer) => customer is
            {
                CreditScore: > 600,
                Income: > 100000
            })
        .WhenTrue(customer => $"customer {customer.Name} is eligible for a loan")      // dynamic explanation when true
        .WhenFalse(customer => $"customer {customer.Name} is not eligible for a loan") // dynamic explanation when false
        .Create("eligible for loan");
```

### Composing propositions
The real power of Motiv comes from composing propositions to form new ones.
The library will take care of collating the underlying causes and filter out irrelevant and inconsequential 
assertions and metadata from the final result. 
Propositions can be composed using the `&`,`|` and `^` operators as well as the supplemental `.OrElse()` and
`.AndAlso()` methods.
This allows you to create explanations at various levels of granularity.

In our example we can break down into its constituent parts, each with their own explanation.
```csharp
var hasGoodCreditScore =
    Spec.Build((Customer customer) => customer.CreditScore > 600)
        .WhenTrue("customer has a good credit score")
        .WhenFalse("customer has an inadequate credit score")
        .Create();

var hasSufficientIncome =
    Spec.Build((Customer customer) => Income: > 100000)
        .WhenTrue("customer has sufficient income")
        .WhenFalse("customer has insufficient income")
        .Create();
    
var isEligibleForLoan = hasGoodCreditScore & hasSufficientIncome; // composing propositions

var result = isEligibleForLoan.IsSatisfiedBy(eligibleCustomer);

result.Satisfied; // true
result.Reason; // "customer has a good credit score & customer has sufficient income"
result.Assertions; // ["customer has a good credit score", "customer has sufficient income"]
```

When composing propositions to form new ones, only the propositions that helped determine the final result 
will be included in the `Assertions` property and `Reason` property.

```csharp
var result = isPositiveAndOddProposition.IsSatisfiedBy(ineligibleCustomer);

result.Satisfied; // false
result.Reason; // "customer has an inadequate credit score"
result.Assertions; // ["customer has an inadequate credit score"]
```

### Encapsulation and Re-use

#### Redefining propositions
Sometimes an existing propositions do not produce the desired assertions or metadata.
In this case, you will need to wrap the existing proposition in a new one.

```csharp
var isEligibleForLoan =
    Spec.Build(hasGoodCreditScore & hasSufficientIncome) // reusing existing propositions
        .WhenTrue("customer is eligible for a loan")
        .WhenFalse("customer is not eligible for a loan")
        .Create();
```

When deriving new propositions, you may still require assertions or metadata from the original.
```csharp
var isEligibleForLoan =
    Spec.Build(hasGoodCreditScore & hasSufficientIncome) 
        .WhenTrue("customer is eligible for a loan")
        .WhenFalse((_, result) => result.Assertions) // reusing assertions from the original propositions
        .Create();

isEligibleForLoan.IsSatisfiedBy(eligibleCustomer).Reason;   // "customer is eligible for a loan"
isEligibleForLoan.IsSatisfiedBy(ineligibleCustomer).Reason; // "customer has an inadequate credit score"
```

#### Strongly typed proposition
You will likely want to encapsulate propositions for reuse across an application.
For this you typically have two options, which is to either return `Spec` instances from members of POCO 
objects, or to derive from the `Spec<TModel>` or `Spec<TModel, TMetadata>` class (the former being merely syntactic 
sugar for `Spec<TModel, string>`).
Using these classes will help you to maintain a separation of concerns and also raise the conspicuity of important 
logic within an application. 

```csharp
public class HasGoodCreditScoreProposition(int threshold) : Spec<int>(   // wrap in a strongly typed proposition
    Spec.Build((Customer customer) => customer.CreditScore > threshold)
        .WhenTrue("customer has a good credit score")
        .WhenFalse("customer has an inadequate credit score")
        .Create());
```
or if a custom object is required for metadata, then you can use the `Spec<TModel, TMetadata>` class instead:
```csharp
public class HasSufficientIncomeProposition(decimal threshold) : Spec<int, MyMetadata>( // MyMetadata is a custom object
    Spec.Build((Customer customer) => Income: > threshold)
        .WhenTrue(new MyMetadata("customer has sufficient income"))  // custom metadata
        .WhenFalse(new MyMetadata("customer has insufficient income"))  // custom metadata
        .Create("has sufficient income"));
```

### Higher Order Logic
To perform logic over collections of models, higher order logical operations are required.
Whilst you can create a first-order proposition that operates on collections of models, yielding explanations (or 
metadata) would be challenging.
This library provides a `.As()` builder method to address this.

#### Built-in higher order logic
Some built-in higher order logical operations are provided for popular operations, but you can also add your own using
extension methods.

The current built-in higher order logical operations are:
- `AsAllSatisfied()`: Creates a proposition that yields a true boolean-result object if all the models in a 
  collection satisfy the proposition, otherwise a false boolean-result object is returned.
- `AsAnySatisfied()`: Creates a proposition that yields a true boolean-result object if any of the models in a 
  collection satisfy the proposition, otherwise a false boolean-result object is returned.
- `AsNoneSatisfied()`: Creates a proposition that yields a true boolean-result object if none of the models in a 
  collection satisfy the proposition, otherwise a false boolean-result object is returned.
- `AsNSatisfied()`: Creates a proposition that yields a true boolean-result object if exactly N models in a 
  collection satisfy the proposition, otherwise a false boolean-result object is returned.
- `AsAtLeastNSatisfied()`: Creates a proposition that yields a true boolean-result object if at least N models in a 
  collection satisfy the proposition, otherwise a false boolean-result object is returned.
- `AsAtMostfNSatisfied()`: Creates a proposition that yields a true boolean-result object if at most N models in a 
  collection satisfy the proposition, otherwise a false boolean-result object is returned.

```csharp
Spec.Build((int n) => n < 0)
    .AsAllSatisfied()               // higher order logic
    .WhenTrue("all are negative")
    .WhenFalse("some are not negative")
    .Create();
```

You can also use an existing proposition instead of a predicate to create a higher order logical operation.
This will give you access to each result and model pair, which can be used to customize the output to a 
particular use-case.

```csharp
Spec.Build(new IsNegativeIntegerProposition())  // existing proposition
    .AsAllSatisfied()
    .WhenTrue("all are negative")
    .WhenFalse(evaluation => evaluation.FalseModels.Select(n => $"{n} is not negative"))
    .Create();
```

#### Dynamic 
When dynamically generating assertions/metadata, you are provided with an _evaluation_ object that contains 
pre-defined properties that can be used to customize the output (such as `TrueModels`, `FalseModels`, `TrueCount`, 
`FalseCount` etc.).
This is to facilitate pattern matching using switch expressions, which results in more readable inline conditional 
checks.

```csharp
var allNegative =
    Spec.Build(new IsNegativeIntegerProposition())
        .AsAllSatisfied()
        .WhenTrue(eval => 
            eval switch
            {
                { Count: 0 } => "there is an absence of numbers",
                { Models: [< 0 and var n] } => $"{n} is negative and is the only number",
                _ => "all are negative numbers"
            })
        .WhenFalse(eval =>
            eval switch
            {
                { Models: [0] } => ["the number is 0 and is the only number"],
                { Models: [> 0 and var n] } => [$"{n} is positive and is the only number"],
                { NoneSatisfied: true } when eval.Models.All(m => m is 0) => ["all are 0"],
                { NoneSatisfied: true } when eval.Models.All(m => m > 0) => ["all are positive numbers"],
                { NoneSatisfied: true } =>  ["none are negative numbers"],
                _ => eval.FalseResults.GetAssertions()
            })
        .Create("all are negative");

allNegative.IsSatisfiedBy([]).Assertions; // ["there is an absence of numbers"]
allNegative.IsSatisfiedBy([-10]).Assertions; // ["-10 is negative and is the only number"]
allNegative.IsSatisfiedBy([-2, -4, -6, -8]).Assertions; // ["all are negative numbers"]
allNegative.IsSatisfiedBy([0]).Assertions; // ["the number is 0 and is the only number"]
allNegative.IsSatisfiedBy([11]).Assertions; // ["11 is positive and is the only number"]
allNegative.IsSatisfiedBy([0, 0, 0, 0]).Assertions; // ["all are 0"]
allNegative.IsSatisfiedBy([2, 4, 6, 8]).Assertions; // ["all are positive numbers"]
allNegative.IsSatisfiedBy([0, 1, 2, 3]).Assertions; // ["none are negative numbers"]
allNegative.IsSatisfiedBy([-2, -4, 0, 9]).Assertions; // ["0 is not negative", "9 is not negative"]
```

## Tradeoffs
There are inevitably potential tradeoffs to consider when using this library.
1. **Performance**: This library is designed to be as performant as possible, but it is still a layer of abstraction
   over the top of native logic.
   This means that there is nevertheless a measurable performance cost compared to computing boolean values natively.
   This cost is negligible in most cases and is generally eclipsed by the benefits provided.
2. **Dependency**: This library is a dependency.
   Once embedded in your codebase it will be challenging to remove. 
   However, this library does not itself depend on any third-party libraries, so it does not bring any unexpected 
   baggage with it. 
3. **Learning Curve**: For many, this library is a new approach and will nonetheless require a bit of familiarization.
   That being said, it has been deliberately designed to be as intuitive and easy to use as possibleâ€”there is 
   relatively little to learn.

### Branching Strategy

     main
        This is the primary branch of the repository. It should always be stable and deployable. 

     develop
        Merged into: main
        Purpose: This branch serves as an integration branch for features. Once a feature is complete, it is merged 
        into develop.  When develop is stable and ready for a release, its contents are merged into main.

     feature/
        Created from: develop
        Merged back into: develop
        Naming convention: feature/ followed by a descriptive name (e.g., feature/add-login)
        Purpose: Used for developing new features. Each feature should have its own branch.

Workflow Summary

    Start a new feature by creating a feature/ branch off develop.
    Once the feature is complete, create a pull request to merge it back into develop.
    Regularly merge develop into release branches for preparing releases.

Additional Notes

    Delete branches post-merge to keep the repository clean.
    Use pull requests for code review and ensure CI checks pass before merging.
    Regularly update branches with the latest changes from their parent branch to avoid large merge conflicts.

This strategy helps in maintaining a clean and manageable workflow, ensuring stability in the main branch, and
enabling continuous development and quick fixes as needed.
