# AndAlsoTogether()

```csharp
BooleanResultBase<TMetadata> AndAlsoTogether<TMetadata>(this IEnumerable<BooleanResultBase<TMetadata>> results)
```

The `AndAlsoTogether()` extension method is used to combine a collection of boolean results into a single boolean result
that is satisfied if all the original results are satisfied.  If the first result is not satisfied, the remaining
results are not evaluated.  This means that any assertions or metadata that would be generated by the
remaining results will not be generated.

```csharp
IEnumerable<BooleanResult<int, string>> results = 
    [
        new IsEvenProposition().IsSatisfiedBy(6),
        new IsGreaterThanProposition(5).IsSatisfiedBy(6)
    ];

var andAlsoTogetherResult = results.AndAlsoTogether();

andAlsoTogetherResult.Reason;  // "is even & is greater than 5"
```
