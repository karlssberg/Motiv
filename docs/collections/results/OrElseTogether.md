# OrElseTogether()

```csharp
BooleanResultBase<TMetadata> OrElseTogether<TMetadata>(this IEnumerable<BooleanResultBase<TMetadata>> results)
```

The `OrElseTogether()` extension method is used to combine a collection of boolean results into a single boolean result
that is satisfied if any of the original results are satisfied.  If the first result is satisfied, the
remaining results are not evaluated.  This means that any assertions or metadata that would be generated by the
remaining results are not generated.

```csharp
var specs = 
    [
        new IsEvenProposition(),
        new IsGreaterThanProposition(5)
    ];

var results = specs.Select(spec => spec.IsSatisfiedBy(6));

var orElseTogetherResult = results.OrElseTogether();

orElseTogetherResult.Reason;  // "is even"
```
